<h2>I.</h2>

<p>When little Mary Moffett's mother asked her to go up to the Clover Farm for some fresh
<img class="inline" src="images/11eggs.jpg" alt="eggs" />, Mary felt a little sorry, for she was very busy making her
<img class="floatright" src="images/11sideimage.jpg" alt="" />
<img class="inline" src="images/11doll.jpg" alt="doll" /> a
<img class="inline" src="images/11dress.jpg" alt="dress" />, but she laid down her
<img class="inline" src="images/11thimble.jpg" alt="thimble" /> and
<img class="inline" src="images/11scissors.jpg" alt="scissors" /> and
<img class="inline" src="images/11thread.jpg" alt="thread" />, tied on her pink
<img class="inline" src="images/11bonnet.jpg" alt="bonnet" />, and set off up the hill, with her little
<img class="inline" src="images/11basket.jpg" alt="basket" /> on her
<img class="inline" src="images/11arm.jpg" alt="arm" />. As she was coming home she heard a queer little patter, patter, behind her. She looked back and saw something white!
<img class="inline" src="images/11mary.jpg" alt="Mary" /> felt a wee bit afraid, and began to run but her
<img class="inline" src="images/11foot.jpg" alt="foot" /> struck a
<img class="inline" src="images/11rock.jpg" alt="rock" /> and down she tumbled on her
<img class="inline" src="images/11nose.jpg" alt="nose" />! Before she could get up something soft and woolly was rubbing gently against her
<img class="inline" src="images/11face.jpg" alt="face" />, saying "Ba-a-a!" "Oh you darling lamb!" cried Mary, hugging it&mdash;and the little
<img class="inline" src="images/11lamb.jpg" alt="lamb" /> snuggled close, and said "Ba-a-a! Take me home with you, little Mary."
<img class="inline" src="images/11mom.jpg" alt="Mother" /> was astonished.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>"Whose lamb is it?" she asked. "Oh Mother,
<img class="floatleft" src="images/13img1.jpg" alt="" /> I think it's just a wild lamb! Mayn't I keep it?" begged
<img class="inline" src="images/13mary.jpg" alt="Mary" />. But Mother said she must ask Farmer Clover if it was one of his
<img class="inline" src="images/13sheep.jpg" alt="sheep" />, first. So back they went, and found
<img class="floatright" src="images/13img2.jpg" alt="" /> Farmer Clover mending his
<img class="inline" src="images/13fence.jpg" alt="fence" /> and Mary asked him. But there were two big tears in her
<img class="inline" src="images/13eyes.jpg" alt="eyes" />&mdash;she did so want that dear
<img class="inline" src="images/13lamb.jpg" alt="lamb" />&mdash;and the kind old
<img class="inline" src="images/13farmer.jpg" alt="farmer" /> saw them. "Well, yes," he said, "that's my lamb&mdash;but it's an extra one, that I haven't any room for. If I knew anybody who would be willing to take it and treat it well&mdash;" "Oh, Mr. Clover!" cried
<img class="inline" src="images/13mary2.jpg" alt="Mary" />, her eyes dancing, now, and her
<img class="inline" src="images/13feet.jpg" alt="feet" /> dancing, too. "<i>I'd</i> be willing! <i>I'd</i> treat it well! May <i>I</i> have it?" So Mary and the little
<img class="inline" src="images/13lamb2.jpg" alt="lamb" /> went dancing home together. And kind old
<img class="inline" src="images/13farmer2.jpg" alt="Mr. Clover" /> watched them and laughed till his
<img class="inline" src="images/13axe.jpg" alt="axe" /> danced in his
<img class="inline" src="images/13hand.jpg" alt="hand" />, and his
<img class="inline" src="images/13glasses.jpg" alt="glasses" /> danced on his
<img class="inline" src="images/13nose.jpg" alt="nose" />.</p>

<p>"Mother! Mother!" cried little Mary, running into the
<img class="inline" src="images/17house.jpg" alt="house" />. "Mr. Clover says he doesn't
<img class="floatright" src="images/17sideimage.jpg" alt="" /> need this
<img class="inline" src="images/17lamb.jpg" alt="lamb" />&mdash;it's extra&mdash;and I may have it for my very own!" Yes, now it was Mary's little lamb&mdash;and how they loved each other! They went together everywhere&mdash;in the
<img class="inline" src="images/17house2.jpg" alt="house" /> and the
<img class="inline" src="images/17barn.jpg" alt="barn" />, and over to Grandfathers, to play with little Aunt Hannah. Mary's Aunt Hannah was only three years older than
<img class="inline" src="images/17mary.jpg" alt="Mary" /> herself and they played together all the time. The two little
<img class="inline" src="images/17girls.jpg" alt="girls" /> thought the
<img class="inline" src="images/17lamb2.jpg" alt="lamb" /> was beautiful, but it was not very clean. "I don't want a dirty, dusty little lamb," said Mary; "I want a nice, clean, white lamb." "Then we must wash it." said little
<img class="inline" src="images/17aunthannah.jpg" alt="Aunt Hannah" />. "Father washes all his
<img class="inline" src="images/17sheep.jpg" alt="sheep" /> in the
<img class="inline" src="images/17river.jpg" alt="river" /> every spring." Out by the
<img class="inline" src="images/17barn.jpg" alt="barn" /> stood the
<img class="inline" src="images/17faucet.jpg" alt="faucet" /> with the big wooden
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
<img class="inline" src="images/19trough.jpg" alt="trough" /> where the
<img class="floatleft" src="images/19img1.jpg" alt="" />
<img class="inline" src="images/19cows.jpg" alt="cows" /> drank. The
<img class="inline" src="images/19trough.jpg" alt="trough" /> was full of water, standing in the
<img class="floatright" src="images/19img2.jpg" alt="" />
<img class="inline" src="images/19sun.jpg" alt="sun" />. Mary leaned over the edge and dipped her
<img class="inline" src="images/19hand.jpg" alt="hand" />. "It's nice and warm," she said. "Now, dear little
<img class="inline" src="images/19lamb.jpg" alt="lamb" /> jump right in!" But the lamb wouldn't jump&mdash;so Mary and little Aunt Hannah lifted him, and dropped him into the
<img class="inline" src="images/19trough.jpg" alt="trough" />. Then they rubbed him with
<img class="inline" src="images/19soap.jpg" alt="soap" />, and squeezed his
<img class="inline" src="images/19fur.jpg" alt="fur" /> with their
<img class="inline" src="images/19hands.jpg" alt="hands" />. The poor little lamb didn't like it, and kept trying to get out&mdash;till, as
<img class="inline" src="images/19mary.jpg" alt="Mary" /> tried to hold him her
<img class="inline" src="images/11foot.jpg" alt="foot" /> slipped and in she fell,
<img class="inline" src="images/19head.jpg" alt="head" /> first! Oh, how she screamed! And
<img class="inline" src="images/19hannah.jpg" alt="Aunt Hannah" /> screamed, too, and the
<img class="inline" src="images/19lamb2.jpg" alt="lamb" /> cried "Ba-a-a!" as loud as he could. Little Aunt Hannah's mother came running from the
<img class="inline" src="images/19house.jpg" alt="house" /> fished them out of the water, and carried them into her
<img class="inline" src="images/19livingroom.jpg" alt="living room" /> one under each
<img class="inline" src="images/19arm.jpg" alt="arm" />. There she rubbed them dry, wrapped them both in
<img class="inline" src="images/19towels.jpg" alt="towels" /> and set them by the
<img class="inline" src="images/19fireplace.jpg" alt="fireplace" />, to get warm.</p>

<p>Mary's lamb was too young to eat
<img class="inline" src="images/23grass.jpg" alt="grass" />, as old
<img class="inline" src="images/23sheep.jpg" alt="sheep" /> do. He wanted milk, but he did not know how to drink from a
<img class="inline" src="images/23bucket.jpg" alt="bucket" />. He was just a baby sheep, you see. So Mary's
<img class="inline" src="images/23mother.jpg" alt="mother" /> found an old tin
<img class="floatright" src="images/23sideimg.jpg" alt="" />
<img class="inline" src="images/23teapot.jpg" alt="teapot" /> and filled it with warm new milk. Then she tied a
<img class="inline" src="images/23cloth.jpg" alt="cloth" /> over the
<img class="inline" src="images/23spout.jpg" alt="spout" />, and
<img class="inline" src="images/23mary.jpg" alt="Mary" /> held it while the little
<img class="inline" src="images/23lamb.jpg" alt="lamb" /> sucked up every drop of the milk. Three times a day they filled the
<img class="inline" src="images/23coffeepot.jpg" alt="teapot" />, and he drank it all, while Mary tilted it up for him. One day
<img class="inline" src="images/23mary2.jpg" alt="Mary" /> and little
<img class="inline" src="images/23hannah.jpg" alt="Aunt Hannah" /> went up Clover
<img class="inline" src="images/23hill.jpg" alt="Hill" /> to pick
<img class="inline" src="images/23berries.jpg" alt="berries" /> for their mothers to put in
<img class="inline" src="images/23pie.jpg" alt="pies" />. They took their luncheon in the berry-
<img class="inline" src="images/23pail.jpg" alt="pail" />, and each had a tin
<img class="inline" src="images/23cup.jpg" alt="cup" /> to pick into. Mary's
<img class="inline" src="images/23lamb2.jpg" alt="lamb" /> went too, and of course he would want his luncheon, so
<img class="inline" src="images/23mary3.jpg" alt="Mary" /> carried the old
<img class="inline" src="images/23coffeepot.jpg" alt="teapot" /> in a
<img class="inline" src="images/23basket.jpg" alt="basket" />. When the
<img class="inline" src="images/23pail2.jpg" alt="pail" /> and
<img class="inline" src="images/23basket2.jpg" alt="basket" /> were full
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span> of
<img class="inline" src="images/25berries.jpg" alt="berries" />, they started home. Along the roadside grew white
<img class="inline" src="images/25flowers.jpg" alt="flowers" />, and they made a
<img class="floatleft" src="images/25img1.jpg" alt="" />
<img class="inline" src="images/25wreath.jpg" alt="wreath" /> for the lamb's
<img class="inline" src="images/25neck.jpg" alt="neck" />. Then Mary said "The
<img class="floatright" src="images/25img2.jpg" alt="" />
<img class="inline" src="images/25sun.jpg" alt="sun" /> shines so, he must be hot. He shall wear my
<img class="inline" src="images/25bonnet.jpg" alt="bonnet" />." So they tied it snugly over his
<img class="inline" src="images/25ears.jpg" alt="ears" />. Then they sat under a
<img class="inline" src="images/25tree.jpg" alt="tree" /> to finish their luncheon, and afterward Mary gave the
<img class="inline" src="images/25lamb.jpg" alt="lamb" /> the rest of his milk. Two
<img class="inline" src="images/25women.jpg" alt="women" /> came past, in a low
<img class="inline" src="images/25carriage.jpg" alt="carriage" />, and they laughed to see the little lamb drinking from the teapot. Mary did not notice that one
<img class="inline" src="images/25woman.jpg" alt="woman" /> held up a little black leather
<img class="inline" src="images/25camera.jpg" alt="camera" /> and pointed it at her. But next week a flat, square
<img class="inline" src="images/25package.jpg" alt="package" /> came from the postoffice marked "For the Little Girl and Lamb who live near Clover Hill."
<img class="inline" src="images/25mary.jpg" alt="Mary" /> cut the
<img class="inline" src="images/25string.jpg" alt="string" /> with her
<img class="inline" src="images/25scissors.jpg" alt="scissors" />, and unfolded the
<img class="inline" src="images/25package2.jpg" alt="package" />&mdash;and what did she find inside it? A beautiful photograph of herself, feeding her
<img class="inline" src="images/25lamb2.jpg" alt="lamb" /> by the roadside!</p>

<p>Mary didn't like to go to school and leave her lamb at home. She knew he would not be happy all alone; and how could she study her
<img class="inline" src="images/29books.jpg" alt="books" /> and do sums on her
<img class="inline" src="images/29slate.jpg" alt="slate" />, without her dear little woolly
<img class="floatright" src="images/29img.jpg" alt="" />
<img class="inline" src="images/29lamb.jpg" alt="lamb" /> close beside her? But schooltime came, and she had to start. If she had looked back, she would have seen the
<img class="inline" src="images/29lamb2.jpg" alt="lamb" /> trotting along behind, all so pretty, with a blue
<img class="inline" src="images/29bow.jpg" alt="bow" /> on his
<img class="inline" src="images/29neck.jpg" alt="neck" />. He loved to follow little Mary, and he didn't know
<img class="inline" src="images/29sheep.jpg" alt="lambs" /> mustn't go to school. Before he caught up with her, the
<img class="inline" src="images/29bell.jpg" alt="bell" /> rang, the
<img class="inline" src="images/29children.jpg" alt="children" /> all ran in, and the
<img class="inline" src="images/29door.jpg" alt="door" /> was shut; but he stood on the door-
<img class="inline" src="images/29step.jpg" alt="step" /> and heard them singing. Then the arithmetic class began, and the
<img class="inline" src="images/29teacher.jpg" alt="teacher" /> said: "Mary, if you had three
<img class="inline" src="images/29apples.jpg" alt="apples" />, and gave one
<img class="inline" src="images/29apple.jpg" alt="apple" /> to Hannah, how many would you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>have left?" Mary was not thinking of
<img class="inline" src="images/31apples.jpg" alt="apples" />. "Four," she said, "but please teacher, did you know I had a
<img class="floatleft" src="images/31img1.jpg" alt="" />
<img class="inline" src="images/31lamb.jpg" alt="lamb" />?" and the lamb heard her voice and called "Baa!" outside the
<img class="inline" src="images/29door.jpg" alt="door" />, as loud as he could. "Why, there he is!" cried
<img class="inline" src="images/31mary.jpg" alt="Mary" />. "He must go home," said the teacher; and she opened the
<img class="floatright" src="images/31img2.jpg" alt="" />
<img class="inline" src="images/31door.jpg" alt="door" /> to send him away. But the little
<img class="inline" src="images/31lamb2.jpg" alt="lamb" /> came right in, and ran to
<img class="inline" src="images/31mary2.jpg" alt="Mary" />, so glad to see her again! "Oh, please let him stay!" said she: "I am sure he will be good!" But all the other
<img class="inline" src="images/31children.jpg" alt="children" /> laughed&mdash;it was so funny to see a lamb in school&mdash;and the
<img class="inline" src="images/31teacher.jpg" alt="teacher" /> had to turn him out. But the
<img class="inline" src="images/31lamb3.jpg" alt="lamb" /> would not go home. He wanted to stay near Mary; So he waited on the
<img class="inline" src="images/31step.jpg" alt="step" /> and every time he heard her voice he cried "Ba-a-a!" At last the
<img class="inline" src="images/29teacher.jpg" alt="teacher" /> said
<img class="inline" src="images/31mary3.jpg" alt="Mary" /> must take him home; so she put away her
<img class="inline" src="images/31books.jpg" alt="books" />, and the little
<img class="inline" src="images/31lamb4.jpg" alt="lamb" /> jumped and danced, he was so happy, as they ran home together.</p>

<p>All the week the little lamb had to stay at home while Mary went to
<img class="inline" src="images/35school.jpg" alt="school" />; but on Saturday they had such good times! First,
<img class="inline" src="images/35mary.jpg" alt="Mary" /> had her tasks to do. She wiped all the
<img class="inline" src="images/35cups.jpg" alt="cups" /> and
<img class="inline" src="images/35plates.jpg" alt="plates" /> and
<img class="inline" src="images/35spoons.jpg" alt="spoons" />, dusted the
<img class="inline" src="images/35chairs.jpg" alt="chairs" /> and made her own
<img class="inline" src="images/35bed.jpg" alt="bed" />. Then she went out to play. The nicest place to "play house" was the
<img class="inline" src="images/35roof.jpg" alt="roof" /> of a
<img class="floatright" src="images/35sideimg1.jpg" alt="" />
<img class="inline" src="images/35hut.jpg" alt="hut" /> by the
<img class="inline" src="images/35barn.jpg" alt="barn" />. Mary and little Aunt Hannah climbed up by the
<img class="inline" src="images/35fence.jpg" alt="fence" />, with their
<img class="inline" src="images/35dolls.jpg" alt="dolls" /> and
<img class="inline" src="images/35teaset.jpg" alt="tea set" /> but the
<img class="inline" src="images/35lamb.jpg" alt="lamb" /> couldn't climb. They tried to carry him, but he was too heavy&mdash;and he kicked, too. So they took him up on the
<img class="inline" src="images/35hay.jpg" alt="straw" /> in the
<img class="inline" src="images/35barn2.jpg" alt="barn" /> and dropped him out of a
<img class="inline" src="images/35window.jpg" alt="window" /> onto the
<img class="inline" src="images/35roof2.jpg" alt="roof" />. Then they all had a good time playing "party", with some caraway
<img class="inline" src="images/35biscuits.jpg" alt="biscuits" /> and a little
<img class="inline" src="images/35jug.jpg" alt="jug" /> of milk. But at noon, when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>Mary's Mother blew the dinner-
<img class="inline" src="images/37whistle.jpg" alt="whistle" />, the lamb couldn't get down! They couldn't lift him up to the
<img class="inline" src="images/37window.jpg" alt="window" />, and he was afraid to jump to the ground. Little Aunt Hannah stood on the
<img class="floatleft" src="images/37sideimg1.jpg" alt="" />
<img class="inline" src="images/37wheel.jpg" alt="wheelbarrrow" />, but could not reach him. Then they brought out armfuls of
<img class="inline" src="images/37straw2.jpg" alt="straw" /> and made a big soft
<img class="floatright" src="images/37sideimg2.jpg" alt="" />
<img class="inline" src="images/37haystack2.jpg" alt="haystack" /> and
<img class="inline" src="images/37mary.jpg" alt="Mary" /> stood on the
<img class="inline" src="images/37roof.jpg" alt="roof" /> and tried to push him off into the
<img class="inline" src="images/37straw.jpg" alt="straw" /> but he wouldn't budge. "Come to dinner, children," called Mary's
<img class="inline" src="images/37mother.jpg" alt="Mother" />. "It is getting cold." "Oh dear!" said little Mary, almost crying. "He'll have to stay up here and starve! But he's had three
<img class="inline" src="images/37biscuits.jpg" alt="caraway biscuits" />, anyway." At last
<img class="inline" src="images/37hannah.jpg" alt="Hannah's" /> big brother came out to find them. He laughed when he saw the
<img class="inline" src="images/37lamb.jpg" alt="lamb" /> and the
<img class="inline" src="images/37haystack.jpg" alt="haystack" /> but he went for a
<img class="inline" src="images/37ladder.jpg" alt="ladder" />, and very quickly brought the little
<img class="inline" src="images/37lamb2.jpg" alt="lamb" /> safely down to the ground. Then they all went in and had their dinner together.</p>

<p>"When my lamb is big enough" said Mary to little Aunt Hannah, "my father will shear him with the
<img class="inline" src="images/41clippers.jpg" alt="clippers" />, like the old
<img class="inline" src="images/41sheep.jpg" alt="sheep" /> and Mother will teach me to spin, and knit the wool; and so my little lamb will give me my
<img class="floatright" src="images/41sideimg.jpg" alt="" />
<img class="inline" src="images/41gloves.jpg" alt="gloves" /> and
<img class="inline" src="images/41socks.jpg" alt="socks" />." "Let's shear  him now." said
<img class="inline" src="images/41hannah.jpg" alt="Aunt Hannah" />. "I can teach you to knit." "Well." said Mary. "He is very little&mdash;but we will only take a little of his
<img class="inline" src="images/41wool.jpg" alt="wool" />." So she got the
<img class="inline" src="images/41scissors.jpg" alt="scissors" />, and they cut some wool from his
<img class="inline" src="images/41back.jpg" alt="back" />. But they found it must first be spun into
<img class="inline" src="images/41yarn.jpg" alt="yarn" />&mdash;and they didn't know how: so they went to ask Mary's
<img class="inline" src="images/41mother.jpg" alt="mother" />. She laughed at the poor little
<img class="inline" src="images/41lamb.jpg" alt="lamb" /> with the big bare spots in his pretty white
<img class="inline" src="images/41fleece.jpg" alt="fleece" />. "If you are in such a hurry for
<img class="inline" src="images/41gloves2.jpg" alt="gloves" /> and
<img class="inline" src="images/41socks.jpg" alt="socks" />," she said, "we will begin them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>at once. First, you must learn to spin." So she brought out the big
<img class="floatleft" src="images/43sideimg1.jpg" alt="" />
<img class="inline" src="images/43spinning.jpg" alt="spinning wheel" /> and some tiny soft
<img class="inline" src="images/43threads.jpg" alt="threads" /> of wool and showed her how to spin the rolls into
<img class="inline" src="images/43yarn.jpg" alt="yarn" />. Mary liked to walk backward and forward, and twirl the great
<img class="floatright" src="images/43sideimg2.jpg" alt="" />
<img class="inline" src="images/43wheel.jpg" alt="spinning wheel" /> with a
<img class="inline" src="images/43pin.jpg" alt="clothes-pin" />; but her yarn was all uneven, and kept snarling and breaking. Soon she grew tired&mdash;and cross, too, and then the
<img class="inline" src="images/43yarn2.jpg" alt="yarn" /> snarled worse than ever. As last
<img class="inline" src="images/43mary.jpg" alt="Mary" /> gave the
<img class="inline" src="images/43wheel.jpg" alt="spinning wheel" /> a great whirl, as hard as she could, and ran off to the
<img class="inline" src="images/43barn.jpg" alt="barn" />. There she hid in the
<img class="inline" src="images/43straw.jpg" alt="straw" /> and cried, until the little
<img class="inline" src="images/43lamb.jpg" alt="lamb" /> found her and rubbed his
<img class="inline" src="images/43head.jpg" alt="head" /> against her
<img class="inline" src="images/43hair.jpg" alt="hair" />. Then she stopped crying to laugh, his ragged
<img class="inline" src="images/43fleece.jpg" alt="fleece" /> looked so funny! Pretty soon she went back to the
<img class="inline" src="images/43house.jpg" alt="house" /> and said she was sorry for being cross. Then
<img class="inline" src="images/43mother.jpg" alt="Mother" /> gave her a nice
<img class="inline" src="images/43ball.jpg" alt="ball" /> of yarn and some
<img class="inline" src="images/43needles.jpg" alt="knitting needles" /> and
<img class="inline" src="images/43hannah.jpg" alt="Aunt Hannah" /> taught her to knit a
<img class="inline" src="images/43sock.jpg" alt="sock" />.</p>

<p>When the time really came to wash and shear the
<img class="inline" src="images/47sheep.jpg" alt="sheep" />, Mary's
<img class="inline" src="images/47father.jpg" alt="father" /> said the lamb wasn't big enough to spare any more
<img class="inline" src="images/47wool.jpg" alt="wool" />&mdash;but he did get washed in the
<img class="floatright" src="images/47side.jpg" alt="" />
<img class="inline" src="images/17river.jpg" alt="river" />. Mary and little Aunt Hannah went down in the meadow to gather cowslips&mdash;not for the pretty
<img class="inline" src="images/47flower.jpg" alt="flowers" /> but to boil in a
<img class="inline" src="images/47pot.jpg" alt="pot" /> for dinner. They took off their
<img class="inline" src="images/47shoes.jpg" alt="shoes" /> and
<img class="inline" src="images/47socks.jpg" alt="socks" /> and splashed about in the wet
<img class="inline" src="images/47grass.jpg" alt="grass" />, filling their
<img class="inline" src="images/47bucket.jpg" alt="bucket" /> with
<img class="inline" src="images/47cowslips.jpg" alt="cowslips" />. They picked some tall blue
<img class="inline" src="images/47flowers.jpg" alt="flowers" /> too, and pulled sweet-flag to eat. To get the sweet
<img class="inline" src="images/47flag.jpg" alt="flag" />, they had to cross a little
<img class="inline" src="images/47bridge.jpg" alt="bridge" /> over the brook. The
<img class="inline" src="images/47lamb.jpg" alt="lamb" /> followed them, but he stepped on a loose
<img class="inline" src="images/47board.jpg" alt="board" />, and it tipped him off into the water! It wasn't deep enough to be over his
<img class="inline" src="images/47head.jpg" alt="head" />, but he waded the wrong way and scrambled out on a little
<img class="inline" src="images/47island.jpg" alt="island" /> in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
<img class="floatleft" src="images/49side1.jpg" alt="" />
middle of the
<img class="inline" src="images/491.jpg" alt="brook" />. They couldn't coax him to wade ashore;&mdash;he didn't like water, and would only shake his
<img class="inline" src="images/492.jpg" alt="head" /> and say "Ba-a-a! No-o-o!" "We must build a
<img class="inline" src="images/493.jpg" alt="bridge" /> for him" said
<img class="inline" src="images/494.jpg" alt="Mary" />. "No," said
<img class="floatright" src="images/49side2.jpg" alt="" />
<img class="inline" src="images/495.jpg" alt="Aunt Hannah" /> "we will get the boat. The
<img class="inline" src="images/496.jpg" alt="boys" /> keep it at the mill." They followed the brook up to the
<img class="inline" src="images/497.jpg" alt="mill" /> and untied the
<img class="inline" src="images/498.jpg" alt="boat" />. There were no
<img class="inline" src="images/499.jpg" alt="oars" />, but they found a long
<img class="inline" src="images/4910.jpg" alt="pole" /> and pushed it along to the
<img class="inline" src="images/4911.jpg" alt="island" />. The little
<img class="inline" src="images/4912.jpg" alt="lamb" /> was very glad to jump in with them. But they could not push the
<img class="inline" src="images/4913.jpg" alt="boat" /> ashore, for the water ran too fast. So they floated along, dipping their
<img class="inline" src="images/4914.jpg" alt="fingers" /> in the water, and watching the little
<img class="inline" src="images/4915.jpg" alt="fish" /> swimming below, till they ran into a
<img class="inline" src="images/4916.jpg" alt="fence" /> across the brook. Then they climbed ashore and went back for their
<img class="inline" src="images/4917.jpg" alt="bucket" /> and
<img class="inline" src="images/4918.jpg" alt="shoes and socks" />. "Oh, you funny lamb!" said Mary, "What good times you do make us have!"</p>

Dollabella, Mary's biggest doll, had had the measles, but she was getting better. "When people get better" said
<img class="inline" src="images/531.jpg" alt="Mary" />, "they always go to ride." So she tried to give her
<img class="inline" src="images/532.jpg" alt="doll" /> a ride on the
<img class="inline" src="images/533.jpg" alt="lamb" />'s back, but he danced up and down and she fell off. Then Mary took a
<img class="inline" src="images/534.jpg" alt="string" /> and tied her on, so when the
<img class="inline" src="images/535.jpg" alt="lamb" /> danced again he couldn't shake
<img class="inline" src="images/536.jpg" alt="Dollabella" /> off. He didn't like that, so he thought he would run away from her, and off he went! The
<img class="inline" src="images/537.jpg" alt="gate" /> was shut, but he squeezed through a gap in the
<img class="inline" src="images/538.jpg" alt="fence" />, and tore Dollabella's
<img class="inline" src="images/539.jpg" alt="dress" /> on a
<img class="inline" src="images/5310.jpg" alt="nail" />. Mary squeezed through the gap, too, and her
<img class="inline" src="images/5311.jpg" alt="skirt" /> caught on the
<img class="inline" src="images/5312.jpg" alt="nail" />, and tore a great big three-cornered
<img class="inline" src="images/5313.jpg" alt="hole" />. The
<img class="inline" src="images/5314.jpg" alt="lamb" /> ran across a field and jumped over a
<img class="inline" src="images/5315.jpg" alt="stone wall" /> into the
<img class="inline" src="images/5316.jpg" alt="bushes" /> and Mary ran after him, laughing.

Dollabella's
<img class="inline" src="images/551.jpg" alt="hat" /> fell off her
<img class="inline" src="images/552.jpg" alt="head" />, and so did Mary's
<img class="floatright" src="images/55right.jpg" alt="" />
<img class="inline" src="images/553.jpg" alt="bonnet" />. The
<img class="inline" src="images/554.jpg" alt="branches" /> of the
<img class="inline" src="images/555.jpg" alt="trees" /> caught her
<img class="inline" src="images/556.jpg" alt="hair" /> and tangled them and almost pulled the
<img class="inline" src="images/557.jpg" alt="doll" /> from the lamb's back. At last they came out into a
<img class="inline" src="images/558.jpg" alt="wheat" />field and saw Farmer Clover at work with his
<img class="inline" src="images/559.jpg" alt="hoe" />. "Hello!" said he. "Who's running away&mdash;you or your lamb?" "Oh, we aren't running away," said
<img class="inline" src="images/5510.jpg" alt="Mary" />, all out of breath. "We are just giving my
<img class="inline" src="images/5511.jpg" alt="doll" /> a ride. She is sick!" "Well, that's a pretty fast ride for anybody that's sick!" said
<img class="inline" src="images/5512.jpg" alt="Farmer Clover" />. "Now I am going to the
<img class="inline" src="images/5513.jpg" alt="barn" />, to get a
<img class="inline" src="images/5514.jpg" alt="jug" /> of molasses. Don't you want to ride home in my
<img class="inline" src="images/5515.jpg" alt="buggy" />?" Mary and the
<img class="inline" src="images/5516.jpg" alt="lamb" /> were tired, and glad to have a ride&mdash;and I think the poor sick
<img class="inline" src="images/5517.jpg" alt="doll" /> must have been just as glad. But when they got home
<img class="inline" src="images/5518.jpg" alt="Mary" /> had to take a

<img class="inline" src="images/5520.jpg" alt="thimble" /> out of her

As the lamb grew big and strong he got very frisky, too. He found out that when he ran at things with his hard little
<img class="inline" src="images/5901.jpg" alt="head" /> down and bunted them, the things would fall down. He thought that was funny, so he bunted everything. In the
<img class="inline" src="images/5902.jpg" alt="house" /> he bunted over
<img class="floatright" src="images/59right.jpg" alt="" />
<img class="inline" src="images/5903.jpg" alt="chairs" /> and the
<img class="inline" src="images/5904.jpg" alt="shovel" /> and
<img class="inline" src="images/5905.jpg" alt="tongs" />, and nobody dared set a
<img class="inline" src="images/5906.jpg" alt="bucket" /> or
<img class="inline" src="images/5907.jpg" alt="tub" /> on the floor. Outdoors, he ran at the
<img class="inline" src="images/5908.jpg" alt="hens" /> and
<img class="inline" src="images/5909.jpg" alt="chicks" />, to see them flutter and scream. Once he bunted little Aunt Hannah's
<img class="inline" src="images/5910.jpg" alt="cat" />&mdash;but she didn't fall down; she stood up and cuffed him with her
<img class="inline" src="images/5911.jpg" alt="paw" />, and scratched him! But
<img class="inline" src="images/5912.jpg" alt="Mary" /> fell down when he bunted her, and so did
<img class="inline" src="images/5913.jpg" alt="Hannah" />, although they were bigger than the
<img class="inline" src="images/5914.jpg" alt="cat" />. One night he ran at Mary's father, bringing in the
<img class="inline" src="images/5915.jpg" alt="pail" />, and spilled all the milk over his
<img class="inline" src="images/5916.jpg" alt="boots" />. Then Mary's
<img class="inline" src="images/5917.jpg" alt="father" /> said
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
<img class="floatleft" src="images/61left.jpg" alt="" />
if the
<img class="inline" src="images/6101.jpg" alt="lamb" /> didn't stop bunting he must be tied up. So
<img class="inline" src="images/6102.jpg" alt="Mary" /> tried to teach him better, but he didn't understand it was naughty, and kept right on bunting. At last one day, he bunted the
<img class="floatright" src="images/61right.jpg" alt="" />
<img class="inline" src="images/6103.jpg" alt="cow" /> which was tied to the
<img class="inline" src="images/6104.jpg" alt="fence" /> by a long
<img class="inline" src="images/6105.jpg" alt="rope" />. Now Bossy liked to bunt, too; so when the
<img class="inline" src="images/6106.jpg" alt="lamb" /> ran at her she put her
<img class="inline" src="images/6107.jpg" alt="head" /> down and ran at him! And she was the biggest, so it was the little
<img class="inline" src="images/6108.jpg" alt="lamb" /> himself that fell down that time! First he flew right over the
<img class="inline" src="images/6109.jpg" alt="fence" /> and fell on his
<img class="inline" src="images/6110.jpg" alt="head" />,&mdash;then he rolled over and over into the duck-
<img class="inline" src="images/6111.jpg" alt="pond" />. All the
<img class="inline" src="images/6112.jpg" alt="ducks" /> began to flap their
<img class="inline" src="images/6113.jpg" alt="wings" /> and quack, and the big gray
<img class="inline" src="images/6114.jpg" alt="goose" /> hissed at him and chased him. The poor naughty little
<img class="inline" src="images/6115.jpg" alt="lamb" /> was so frightened that he ran to
<img class="inline" src="images/6116.jpg" alt="Mary" />, all wet and muddy, and hid his
<img class="inline" src="images/6117.jpg" alt="head" /> in her
<img class="inline" src="images/6118.jpg" alt="dress" />. After that, he didn't bunt things any more!</p>

<p>One day Mary and her lamb were playing in the
<img class="inline" src="images/6501.jpg" alt="barn" />. He would lie still as a
<img class="inline" src="images/6502.jpg" alt="mouse" /> while she buried him in the
<img class="inline" src="images/6503.jpg" alt="hay" />, but when she clapped her
<img class="floatright" src="images/65right.jpg" alt="" />
<img class="inline" src="images/6504.jpg" alt="hands" /> he jumped up and ran to her like a
<img class="inline" src="images/6505.jpg" alt="dog" />. Then
<img class="inline" src="images/6506.jpg" alt="Mary" /> began to pull out
<img class="inline" src="images/6507.jpg" alt="hay" /> from the mow, and made a deep hole where they could both creep in out of sight. After supper they played hide-and-seek with
<img class="inline" src="images/6508.jpg" alt="Hannah" />. So many nice hiding-places&mdash;under the
<img class="inline" src="images/6509.jpg" alt="flower" />-bushes, behind the rain-
<img class="inline" src="images/6510.jpg" alt="barrel" />, and around the
<img class="inline" src="images/6511.jpg" alt="wood" /> by the
<img class="inline" src="images/6512.jpg" alt="woodshed" />. At last
<img class="inline" src="images/6513.jpg" alt="Mary" /> remembered her hole in the
<img class="inline" src="images/6514.jpg" alt="hay" /> and crept in, with the
<img class="inline" src="images/6515.jpg" alt="lamb" /> which followed her everywhere. Then they waited, keeping very still, till by and by
<img class="inline" src="images/6516.jpg" alt="Mary" /> grew sleepy&mdash;for it was almost
<img class="inline" src="images/6517.jpg" alt="bed" />-time. She laid her
<img class="inline" src="images/6518.jpg" alt="head" /> on the
<img class="inline" src="images/6519.jpg" alt="lamb" />'s soft neck, as they cuddled down together in their
<img class="inline" src="images/6520.jpg" alt="nest" />, and before they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
knew it they were fast asleep!
<img class="inline" src="images/6701.jpg" alt="Hannah" /> hunted and hunted, till she thought
<img class="floatleft" src="images/67left.jpg" alt="" />
<img class="inline" src="images/6702.jpg" alt="Mary" /> must have gone in the
<img class="inline" src="images/6703.jpg" alt="house" />, to play a trick on her; so she went into her own
<img class="floatright" src="images/67right.jpg" alt="" />
<img class="inline" src="images/6704.jpg" alt="house" /> a little vexed.
<img class="inline" src="images/6705.jpg" alt="Bed" />-time came and her
<img class="inline" src="images/6706.jpg" alt="Mother" /> came to the
<img class="inline" src="images/6707.jpg" alt="door" /> to call Mary in. "I guess she's gone home with Hannah," said
<img class="inline" src="images/6708.jpg" alt="father" />, as he came from the
<img class="inline" src="images/6709.jpg" alt="barn" /> with his
<img class="inline" src="images/6710.jpg" alt="lamp" />. The
<img class="inline" src="images/6711.jpg" alt="girls" /> often slept together, and Mary's mother didn't hear the "I guess," so she only said "It is naughty to go without telling me. She mustn't again." So nobody knew where
<img class="inline" src="images/6712.jpg" alt="Mary" /> was, all night! But next morning she didn't come home&mdash;she was not at
<img class="inline" src="images/6713.jpg" alt="Hannah" />'s&mdash;and how frightened everybody was! They hunted everywhere, and at last started to drive to the neighbor's
<img class="inline" src="images/6714.jpg" alt="houses" />. The noise of the
<img class="inline" src="images/6715.jpg" alt="carriage" /> and of the
<img class="inline" src="images/6716.jpg" alt="horse" /> trampling on the
<img class="inline" src="images/6717.jpg" alt="street" /> waked Mary&mdash;and how astonished everybody was, when she and the
<img class="inline" src="images/6718.jpg" alt="lamb" /> came creeping out of the
<img class="inline" src="images/6719.jpg" alt="hay" />!</p>

<p>Once little Mary and her lamb really did get lost&mdash;and something dreadful almost happened! They had been picking
<img class="inline" src="images/7101.jpg" alt="berries" /> in the
<img class="inline" src="images/7102.jpg" alt="bushes" /> up Clover
<img class="inline" src="images/7103.jpg" alt="hill" />, and couldn't find the way out. The
<img class="inline" src="images/7104.jpg" alt="sun" /> was setting, and
<img class="inline" src="images/7105.jpg" alt="Mary" /> thought of
<img class="inline" src="images/7106.jpg" alt="snakes" /> and
<img class="floatright" src="images/71right.jpg" alt="" />
<img class="inline" src="images/7107.jpg" alt="bears" />! She was tired and hungry, too. She was eating
<img class="inline" src="images/7108.jpg" alt="blueberries" /> from her
<img class="inline" src="images/7109.jpg" alt="pail" />, and crying, and the
<img class="inline" src="images/7110.jpg" alt="lamb" />, who would not eat
<img class="inline" src="images/7111.jpg" alt="berries" /> and wanted his milk in the old
<img class="inline" src="images/7112.jpg" alt="coffepot" /> was crying, too&mdash;"Ba-a-a!"&mdash;when a big, tall
<img class="inline" src="images/7113.jpg" alt="boy" /> with a
<img class="inline" src="images/7114.jpg" alt="rifle" /> in his
<img class="inline" src="images/7115.jpg" alt="hand" /> broke through the bushes behind them. He sat down on a
<img class="inline" src="images/7116.jpg" alt="stump" /> and stared at them, looking so white and scared that
<img class="inline" src="images/7117.jpg" alt="Mary" /> felt sorry for him. "Did a
<img class="inline" src="images/7118.jpg" alt="bear" /> chase you?" she asked. "Oh no," said he, "It's only I'm so glad you are alive!" He didn't dare tell her he had mistaken her little brown
<img class="inline" src="images/7119.jpg" alt="head" /> bobbing among the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
<img class="floatleft" src="images/73left.jpg" alt="" />
<img class="inline" src="images/7301.jpg" alt="leaves" />, for a
<img class="inline" src="images/7302.jpg" alt="bird" />, and raised his
<img class="inline" src="images/7303.jpg" alt="gun" /> to shoot it when he saw a little white
<img class="inline" src="images/7304.jpg" alt="lamb" /> bobbing beside it and stopped to look closer! So her little
<img class="floatright" src="images/73right.jpg" alt="" />
<img class="inline" src="images/7305.jpg" alt="lamb" /> had saved Mary's life&mdash;but she never knew it. "Now how came you up here?" the boy asked. "Are you lost?" "Oh no," said
<img class="inline" src="images/7306.jpg" alt="Mary" />, winking away the
<img class="inline" src="images/7307.jpg" alt="tears" />, and smiling; "We aren't exactly lost&mdash;only we can't just find our
<img class="inline" src="images/7308.jpg" alt="home" />. And we want our supper, too." "You shall have it!" said the
<img class="inline" src="images/7309.jpg" alt="boy" />. "You are little Mary&mdash;I know your
<img class="inline" src="images/7310.jpg" alt="house" />&mdash;and I'm going to carry you there, quicker than a
<img class="inline" src="images/7311.jpg" alt="horse" /> can trot!" So he took
<img class="inline" src="images/7312.jpg" alt="Mary" /> in one
<img class="inline" src="images/7313.jpg" alt="arm" /> and the
<img class="inline" src="images/7314.jpg" alt="lamb" /> in the other, and the
<img class="inline" src="images/7315.jpg" alt="gun" /> he left hidden in the
<img class="inline" src="images/7316.jpg" alt="forest" /> under a
<img class="inline" src="images/7317.jpg" alt="tree" />. Then he quickly found the
<img class="inline" src="images/7318.jpg" alt="road" /> (it was close by, after all,) and in ten minutes they were safe home again; and Mary's
<img class="inline" src="images/7319.jpg" alt="mother" /> thanked the big
<img class="inline" src="images/7320.jpg" alt="boy" /> and gave them all some supper.</p>

<p>Now Mary and the big
<img class="inline" src="images/7701.jpg" alt="boy" /> with the
<img class="inline" src="images/7702.jpg" alt="gun" /> became great friends. He used to bring her
<img class="inline" src="images/7703.jpg" alt="candy" /> in his
<img class="inline" src="images/7704.jpg" alt="satchel" />; once he took her out in his
<img class="inline" src="images/7705.jpg" alt="boat" /> to gather
<img class="inline" src="images/7706.jpg" alt="flowers" />; and he promised to take her to the County Fair. Early on that day he came for her with his
<img class="floatright" src="images/77right.jpg" alt="" />
<img class="inline" src="images/7707.jpg" alt="horse" /> and
<img class="inline" src="images/7708.jpg" alt="carriage" />. Mary was all ready, in her new
<img class="inline" src="images/7709.jpg" alt="hat" />, with
<img class="inline" src="images/7710.jpg" alt="bows" /> on her
<img class="inline" src="images/7711.jpg" alt="shoes" />. "Where is the
<img class="inline" src="images/7712.jpg" alt="lamb" />?" he asked. "
<img class="inline" src="images/7713.jpg" alt="Father" /> says he mustn't go," said Mary sadly, "so I shut him up in the
<img class="inline" src="images/7714.jpg" alt="barn" />". "Oh but he must go!" cried the
<img class="inline" src="images/7715.jpg" alt="boy" />. "He's entered&mdash;they expect him."
<img class="inline" src="images/7716.jpg" alt="Mary" /> didn't understand that, but she was very glad to take her dear
<img class="inline" src="images/7717.jpg" alt="lamb" /> with her. They walked about the Fair grounds and saw the
<img class="inline" src="images/7718.jpg" alt="horses" /> and
<img class="inline" src="images/7719.jpg" alt="cows" /> and
<img class="inline" src="images/7720.jpg" alt="sheep" /> and
<img class="inline" src="images/7721.jpg" alt="pigs" /> in the
<img class="inline" src="images/7722.jpg" alt="pens" />; and visited the
<img class="inline" src="images/7723.jpg" alt="tent" /> where the
<img class="inline" src="images/7724.jpg" alt="rabbits" /> and
<img class="inline" src="images/7725.jpg" alt="chickens" /> were, in their
<img class="inline" src="images/7726.jpg" alt="cages" />. And everywhere
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
<img class="floatleft" src="images/79left.jpg" alt="" />that
<img class="inline" src="images/7901.jpg" alt="Mary" /> went the
<img class="inline" src="images/7902.jpg" alt="lamb" /> kept close beside her; and all the
<img class="inline" src="images/7903.jpg" alt="people" /> looked at them and smiled. At last the
<img class="inline" src="images/7904.jpg" alt="boy" /> said, "Now we are going into the
<img class="floatright" src="images/79right.jpg" alt="" />
<img class="inline" src="images/7905.jpg" alt="exhibit hall" /> so we will leave our
<img class="inline" src="images/7906.jpg" alt="lamb" /> in this nice little
<img class="inline" src="images/7907.jpg" alt="pen" /> beside all the other
<img class="inline" src="images/7908.jpg" alt="lambs" /> to wait for us." They looked at the
<img class="inline" src="images/7909.jpg" alt="fruits" /> and
<img class="inline" src="images/7910.jpg" alt="flowers" /> and the
<img class="inline" src="images/7911.jpg" alt="quilts" /> and
<img class="inline" src="images/7912.jpg" alt="preserves" /> in the
<img class="inline" src="images/7913.jpg" alt="exhibit hall" />. Then they found Marys
<img class="inline" src="images/7914.jpg" alt="father" /> and
<img class="inline" src="images/7915.jpg" alt="mother" /> and had dinner together; and afterward they saw the
<img class="inline" src="images/7916.jpg" alt="horse" /> race, and the
<img class="inline" src="images/7917.jpg" alt="hot-air balloon" /> go up, and heard the
<img class="inline" src="images/7918.jpg" alt="marching band" /> play. It was a long time before they went for the
<img class="inline" src="images/7919.jpg" alt="lamb" />. Some
<img class="inline" src="images/7920.jpg" alt="people" /> were looking at him, and just as Mary ran up they fastened a blue
<img class="inline" src="images/7921.jpg" alt="ribbon" /> on his
<img class="inline" src="images/7922.jpg" alt="head" />. "Oh, thank you! How pretty!" she said. "Hurrah!" cried the
<img class="inline" src="images/7923.jpg" alt="boy" />. "Our
<img class="inline" src="images/7924.jpg" alt="lamb" /> has won first prize! That means he's the best
<img class="inline" src="images/7925.jpg" alt="lamb" /> in town!" "Of course!" said little
<img class="inline" src="images/7926.jpg" alt="Mary" />. "He's the best
<img class="inline" src="images/7927.jpg" alt="lamb" /> in the whole
<img class="inline" src="images/7928.jpg" alt="world" />!"</p>
